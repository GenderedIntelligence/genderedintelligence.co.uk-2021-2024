<strong>The Trans Writes campaign is on hiatus during the COVID-19 crisis</strong></p>

<h2>What’s happening with the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) now?</h2>

<p>The changes <a href="https://www.genderedintelligence.co.uk/gra"> we’re pushing for with the GRA</a> aren’t going to come easily. We can’t rest on our laurels and assume they’re going to come without asking for them, again and again.</p>

<h2>When trans rights are under attack, what do we do? WRITE BACK!</h2>

<p>Following the closing of the Gender Recognition Act consultation in October 2018, we launched a new campaign called 'Trans Writes!'. This campaign is all about writing to your MP so they know just how precarious trans rights are in the UK, and how they can support us.</p>

<p>That’s why we’re asking you to keep writing to your MP, keep writing to members of the House of Lords (<em>and keep telling your aunts and uncles, Paula down the shops, your friends and teachers and the ticket inspector on the train</em>) about the changes and why they’re so sorely needed.</p>

<p>When we asked you to get the word out before the consultation closed, hundreds of you from every corner of the country wrote with passion and beauty, making the simple case that we need respect and recognition.</p>

<p>We’ve made this very easy form to write to your MP to explain why you’re passionate about the proposed changes to the GRA. The main asks are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>making it easier and cheaper for people to apply</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>removing several layers of bureaucracy</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>legal recognition of non-binary people</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>access for under-18s</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>It's super easy and can take as little as a few seconds, depending on how much you want to personalise it:</p>
