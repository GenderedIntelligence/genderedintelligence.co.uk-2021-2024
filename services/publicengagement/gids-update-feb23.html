<h2>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</h2><br><br>


A recent <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvm98d/tavistock-centre">Vice article</a> suggests that the new regional centres intended to replace GIDS are nowhere near ready to come online, and are unlikely to be ready by the Spring 2023 deadline.<br><br>

We have previously expressed our concerns both publicly in the press and internally in our policy work about the lack of information about the new centres and the lack of communication between the NHS and patients and their families. We must hold NHS England commissioning, who are responsible for these services, to account. To this end we are urgently seeking further information, including clarification on the status of the new centres and the immediate future of GIDS. <br><br>

The treatment of gender identity services in the UK - and particularly of youth services - has consistently been a case of too little, too late, and this most recent news will cause distress to many of us in the community, especially young trans people and their families. <br><br>

However, we must as much as possible avoid panic or misinformation. It is our understanding that GIDS is not in danger of closing in the coming weeks, and that referrals can still be made (although still with an unacceptable wait time of over two years for a first appointment).<br><br>

As much as possible we must support each other as a community in these difficult times, and not lose our heads or our hope. There is a lot that we don’t know, but we can say with absolute certainty that Gendered Intelligence and our colleagues across the sector will continue to care and fight for our young people.<br><br>

We will update with further information as soon as we get it. As always, solidarity and love.<br><br>

If you’re affected by the news, you can phone our support line and/or email youthwork@genderedintelligence.co.uk for support from our youth & community team.
