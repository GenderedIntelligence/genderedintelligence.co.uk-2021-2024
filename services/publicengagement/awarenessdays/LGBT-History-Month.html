		<h2>LGBT+ History - An Abridged Timeline</h2><br>
		For LGBT+ History Month 2022 we've highlighted some of the key milestones for LGBT+ people over the centuries. At a time when it can sometimes feel like our existence is up for debate, it's important to remind ourselves that we've always been here. It's just as important to recognise how recently some of our rights were won - and to keep up the fight that those who came before us started.<br><br>

	  Until this point marriages had been governed by canon law, and there were few legal requirements. Although canon law did not permit equal marriage, we can speculate that prior to the introduction of legal restrictions it would have been possible for a person ‘living as a man/woman’ to get married with comparative ease. This Act marks a turning point from which who can get married -  and how - is increasingly regulated and monitored by the state.<br></div></span>

The Act widens the definition of criminal offences in the UK, enabling expressions of affection between men of any kind to be prosecuted. This leads to widespread persecution of both gay men and transfeminine people. Although female homosexuality was not outlawed it was still subject to discrimination, with legal prohibition being considered in 1921.<br>

	Magnus Hirschfeld founds the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft in Berlin’s Tiergarten. Inspired by the work of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, he builds an LGBT community in and around Berlin and grows an international influence. At the Institut he pioneers the medical techniques that will become the basis of present-day gender-affirming healthcare, and builds a research library dedicated to the history of gender diversity. <br>

A period of intense activity around LGBT+ rights, in the UK and around the world. In ‘66 The Beaumont Society is founded. Initially intended to educate, inform, and combat prejudice around ‘transvestitism’, it goes on to become one of the largest support organisations for trans and non-binary people in the world. In ‘67, the first legislation based on the Wolfenden Report is published in the form of the Sexual Offences Act, partially legalising homosexual sex acts between men in private (Scotland and Ireland do not follow suit until 1980 and 1981, respectively). Discrimination against LGBT+ people is still rampant, but a counter-movement increasingly gathers momentum among the community and allies. <br>

	The Thatcher administration introduces Section 28, prohibiting the promotion of homosexuality by local authorities or in education. Although the law specifies ‘homosexuality’, it effectively blanket bans any positive discussion of LGBT+ issues. The impact is particularly felt in education, where neither teachers nor students can be out without fear of reprisal. This law will last until 2003.<br>

	The UK Passport Office rejects Christie Elan-Cane's application for a passport with a gender-neutral marker. Per goes on to sue the Home Office in 2018 over its refusal to legally recognise non-binary people, eventually taking the case to the Supreme Court in 2021. The Court overturns the case, ruling that the government has no obligation to legally recognise additional gender categories. Elan-Cane promises to take it to the European Court of Human Rights.<br>

Although both UK and European courts have repeatedly ruled against transgender people in previous years, on this occasion the Court found that Goodwin’s right to private life and right to marriage had both been breached, a ruling which led directly to the introduction of the Gender Recognition Act.<br>

	The Civil Partnership Act allows couples of the same legal gender to form civil partnerships (pictured: Grainne Close and Shannon Sickles, the second couple to register a civil partnership in the UK), and the Gender Recognition Act allows trans men and women to pursue legal recognition of their gender identity. However, the procedure for changing legal gender is costly and difficult, and uptake is extremely low. Many transgender people still cannot have the correct gender recorded on their birth, marriage, or death certificates. Consultations on reforms to simplify the GRA are opened in 2018, but government response is minimal, and by 2022 serious reform has yet to occur.<br>

	The Equality Act 2006 consolidates existing human rights laws and seeks to bring the UK in line with the European Human Rights Act. It provides legal protection from discrimination in the workplace to seven protected characteristics, among them sex and gender reassignment. It extends existing protections for transgender people, particularly in the provision of goods and services. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is set up as an independent human rights body to oversee the Act.<br>

	In 2010 the Equality Act is expanded to offer wider protections, including in education, consumer rights, and tenants’ rights. It also introduces protections against discrimination by association. This forms the foundation of present LGBT+ legal protections, although inconsistent application and a lack of clarity in some specific cases has meant that the Act has not always provided effective protection.<br>

	The Marriage (Same-Sex Couples) Act allows people of the same legal sex to marry for the first time. Transgender people in existing marriages can now change their legal sex without needing to first obtain a divorce or annulment. Also in 2013, the Colorado Civil Rights Division rules in favour of a six-year-old trans girl’s right to use toilet facilities in accordance with her gender identity. This sparks a long and ongoing series of legislative battles in the US over ‘bathroom bills’, seeking to protect or prohibit trans people’s access to toilet facilities.<br>

	Prime Minister Theresa May calls for a total ban on conversion practices in the UK, calling them “abhorrent”. In 2021 the UK Government opens a consultation on proposed reforms, which are criticised for allowing loopholes for conversion practices in certain settings, particularly faith and healthcare. In 2022 the Equality and Human Rights Commission, a nominally independent advisory body, recommends the exclusion of trans people from any future legislation on conversion practices.<br>

	  In 2020 <i>Mrs A and Bell v Tavistock</i> the plaintiffs Mrs A and Keira Bell are successful in a judicial review against the NHS Tavistock and Portman Trust which, among other things, claimed that puberty blockers were an 'experimental' treatment and that access to them was too easy for young people. The decision is successfully appealed in 2021 by the Good Law Project, with Gendered Intelligence acting as co-appellant. The Court of Appeal ruled that the initial judgement should never have been made, and that the court should not have exercised judgement on gender-affirming care or on Gillick Competence (the legal mechanism by which under-16s are able to provide informed consent to medical treatment).<br>

	The EHRC releases two statements, one on the proposed conversion therapy ban and another on reforms to the Gender Recognition Act. Both are plainly trans-exclusionary, and represent a surprising move away from the Commission's previous position on trans rights. Many LGBTQ+ organisations cut ties with the Commission in response. Not long thereafter leaked documents suggest a relationship between the EHRC and notable anti-trans groups, and an agenda to exclude trans people - in particular, transfeminine people - from single-sex spaces. The EHRC makes broad claims of misinformation but does not specifically deny the leaked documents.<br>
