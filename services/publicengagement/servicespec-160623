<h2>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</h2><br><br>


<p>We’ve spent the past few days going over the new service specification from NHS England for youth gender identity services.</p>

<p>This document will shape the new services that are being set up around the country to replace GIDS.</p>

<p>The service specification is long and complex, and - as always - some of the reporting on it isn’t honest or accurate.</p>

<p>Here are our main takeaways, as clearly and simply as possible:</p>

<p>It’s not as bad as we feared, but there’s still some way to go. Some of the worst parts of the draft we saw last year have been toned down, but there are still areas of concern.</p>

<p>On the positive side, the new specification is clear that decisions around social transition - changing your hair, clothes, name, and so on - lie with young people and their families. This is important - it should never be the case that a doctor, a teacher, or anyone else gets to make these choices for a young person.</p>

<p>We’re also pleased to see that the specification shows some understanding of the diverse needs of young trans people, and is advocating for better support. 
And some of the medical evidence has - finally - been brought in line with international standards, including references to the ICD-11 and the WPATH Standards of Care 8.</p>

<p>That said, this specification still has needless gatekeeping and barriers to care.</p>

<p>The multidisciplinary review team for referrals is not only being retained, but expanded.</p>

<p>We’ve also seen that young people who need puberty-delaying treatments will have to enrol in a research protocol. It’s unethical to force a group of people to submit to research in order to get healthcare, and it could stop young people from getting essential support at a vulnerable time.</p>

<p>We do know that nobody who is already on puberty-delayed treatments will be taken off them, even if they don’t want to enrol in the research protocol.</p>

<p>There’s a lot that’s still unclear, including who will qualify for the research protocol and what is meant in the specification by ‘early onset gender dysphoria’. We’ve reached out to NHS England for urgent clarification and will provide further information as soon as we have it.</p>

<p>Despite our concerns, we’re cautiously optimistic to see the services going ahead. It’s happening slowly, and we need to see some hard results before we can rebuild trust with NHS England, but it’s a start.</p>

<p>The most important thing is not to give up hope. We know there’s a lot of disillusionment around the future of gender identity services in the UK, but for lots of us it remains the only way to access essential care.</p>

<p>Stay with us. We’re going to keep working with the NHS to advocate for our community, to improve these services in any way we can, and to build a better future for our young people.</p>

<p>If you're currently receiving, waiting for, or trying to access gender identity services and need support, advice, or just a listening ear, you can call our support line. <a href="https://genderedintelligence.co.uk/projects/supportline.html">Times and details available here</a>.</p>
