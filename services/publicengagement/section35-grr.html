<h2>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</h2><br><br>

We are not a “<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/keir-starmer-says-jeremy-corbyns-plans-are-gone-as-labour-writes-manifesto-from-scratch/ar-AA16nZHO">political football</a>”. This is our lives. The Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill is ultimately a minor bill introduced and passed by an overwhelming majority of MSPs from all political parties, and to sideline it now for perceived political expedience is an act of constitutional arson. This will likely serve only to further already widespread concerns in Scotland about Westminster’s perceived wont to railroad and denigrate decisions made within Scotland’s parliament. <br><br>
We are tired of a political discourse that is completely consumed by the anti-trans ‘culture war’. On the one hand, we have the leader of the Labour party claiming that 16 is too young to change legal gender whilst the manifesto all of its MPs were elected on continues <a href="https://labour.org.uk/manifesto-2019/">advocating for the voting age to be lowered to 16</a>. Meanwhile, the UK Government’s Secretary of State for Scotland has already acknowledged that reforms around legal gender recognition are entirely within the competence of the Scottish parliament, whilst seeking to cancel them from on high regardless. <br><br>This short-sighted move loses sight of the real reasons at the heart of GRA reform: the humanity of trans people. All we want is the same freedom as everyone else to marry, to die with dignity, to be recognised as ourselves. By triggering section 35 this government has made what is fundamentally a human rights issue into a show of sabre-rattling, and affirmed its commitment to an anti-trans agenda.
<br><br>
As far as the culture wars go, these are pyrrhic and short-term victories. We trust the Scottish Government will bring this to court, and that they will succeed in having this Section 35 order annulled. At the same time, the two main political parties across the UK seem to have hitched their wagon to the ailing anti-gender ideology, with the presumed hope that somehow agitating “the trans debate” will help them win the next election. <br><br>
But trans people, and our very basic demands for legal recognition, are going nowhere.
