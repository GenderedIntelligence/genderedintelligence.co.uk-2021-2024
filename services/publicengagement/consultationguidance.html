<h2>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</h2><br><br>

<h3>Consultation Guidance</h3>

<p>Last year the government published guidance for schools on how to support transgender students.</p>

<p>The guidance was first promised in 2018, but repeated delays and conflicts within the government left educators waiting over five years.</p>

<p></p>The guidance is non-statutory, meaning it does not change the law, but it is still important and useful to respond. It is open to public consultation until March 12th 2024. <strong><a href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/equalities-political-impartiality-anti-bullying-team/gender-questioning-children-proposed-guidance/">You can respond to the consultation here.</a></strong> </p>

<p>We agree with some of the fundamental principles of this guidance. However, we are concerned about the distressing language used towards trans pupils and their friends and families, and about the proposed exclusion of trans pupils from toilets, sports, and physical activity.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve joined forces with other LGBT+ organisations to produce a guide to the consultation. This explains the government guidance and gives advice to help you respond.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.the-tlp.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Consultation-response-guidelines.pdf">You can find the guide here.</a></strong></p>

We particularly want to hear from young trans people, parents and carers, and educators.
