<h2>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</h2><br><br>

In November 2022, a coalition including Gendered Intelligence and Good Law Project brought NHS England to court, arguing that disproportionately long waiting times for trans healthcare were discriminatory. We argued that these waiting times, predating the pandemic and current waiting times crises within the NHS by many years, showed how the NHS was abdicating its legal duty to offer first appointments for trans-related healthcare services within 18 weeks.<br><br>
Today’s judgment infers that even where there are clearly disproportionate waiting times for trans healthcare, this is not discriminatory, and that further still even if it were, that NHS England is taking actions in order to not be in active breach of its legal duties. On this and other grounds, we failed to convince the judge that these are failings at such a scale that the court should enforce an order or a declaration.<br><br>
Gendered Intelligence has been clear from the start of this case that while any legal outcome is important, of equal importance to us is raising awareness more widely of the dire straits trans healthcare finds itself in the UK. As a trans-led charity, our central aim is around increasing understandings of gender diversity. The main silver lining we find here is that, despite having lost the legal case at this point, we have succeeded in having trans voices heard and stories shared, and of helping to increase understandings of gender diversity, and our healthcare needs and concerns communicated with the wider public. We have helped galvanise our communities, with the resounding message that ‘enough is enough’ being met with a great deal of sympathetic media coverage and well wishes. <br><br>
We understand that this judgment will be difficult for many people, namely those trying to navigate what are plainly horrendous and unjust waiting times themselves. We too are disappointed, and send solace and strength to everyone having to face these uphill battles just to access basic healthcare. <br><br>
The fight for adequate and equal healthcare for trans people goes on: we will be seeking to <a href="https://goodlawproject.org/update/good-law-project-will-appeal-high-court-decision-on-trans-waiting-times/">appeal the judgment</a>. We will continue to stand up for people’s right to timely healthcare, including trans people, and hope that we as a community can help make access to this a reality sooner rather than later.
