<b>Interim service specification for specialist gender dysphoria services for children and young people in England</b>.<br><br>

The current Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), which provides support and healthcare for children and young people with gender dysphoria, is being closed and replaced by a new service model, as recommended by the <a href="https://cass.independent-review.uk/publications/interim-report/">Interim Report of the Cass Review.</a> <br><br>

The full service is not expected until 2023/24, but an interim service is being designed to span the gap. This is intended to open in Spring 2023. <br><br>

The NHS is consulting on the interim specification: this means that they want to hear the public’s views so they can make sure they get it right. The consultation is open until 4 December 2022. We have provided guidance below, written with Stonewall, Mermaids, and the Trans Learning Partnership, to help you write your answers so you can give your input too! <br><br>

We’re quite concerned about the specification, as it suggests a desire to limit care and reduce access to transition. The evidence on how best to care for and support young trans people and gender questioning people points away from this as an approach to care. We think that this specification can be far better than it is, and we hope that our feedback, and yours, will help improve it. <br><br>
