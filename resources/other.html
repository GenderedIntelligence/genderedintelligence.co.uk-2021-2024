<h2>Resources produced by other organisations</h2>

<p>Below are resources for trans people produced by other organisations and services. We've put them in to categories to help you find what you're looking for. Most of the resources we've included are produced for the UK, but we've included a few others that we think are useful. We've put our resources in the categories too so you can see all what's available all on one page. To find more detailed info on Gendered Intelligence resources, go to our <a href="index.html">main resource page</a>.</p>
