<h2>Resources for Young Trans People</h2>

<p>Gendered Intelligence has produced a number of resources by and for trans young people and gender questioning young people in the UK and beyond. You can view them as PDFs for free.</p>

<h2>Knowledge is Power: A Guide for Young Trans People</h2>

<p><a href="https://genderedintelligence.co.uk/projects/kip">Knowledge is Power: A Guide for Young Trans People</a> is an update on a resource from 2015 (see below), providing key information for young trans people, as well as families, carers, friends and loved ones. This resource includes key information about exploring your gender, accessing support, finding community, transition, gender expression and style guides, mental health, sports groups, legal rights as well trans joy and much more!</p>

<p>Through this resource you can gain a better understanding of how to navigate the world as a young trans person, and find empowering and useful knowledge for wherever you may be on your trans or gender questioning journey. It is written by the community for the community and we hope you will find it useful.</p>

<h2>'Free To Be Me' E-Zine</h2>

<p>The "Free to be me" project looked to introduce the topic of Hate Crime to our young members, and looked at knowing one's rights. It was carried out in collaboration with Galop. Galop is an anti-violence charity that works in London with everyone who has experienced homophobia, transphobia and biphobia, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. They also work with people who have experienced any violence, safety issues or problems with the police, but would prefer to talk to a lesbian, gay, bi, trans, or queer community organisation about it. The message of the project was "If it feels wrong, then it is wrong".</p>
