<h2>Youth Groups for Young Trans and Gender Variant People</h2>

<div id="generalinfo">Gendered Intelligence run trans youth groups in London, Leeds and online for a range of ages from 7 to 30. We also run groups specifically for young trans people of colour and transfeminine young people, as well as extra projects such as a swimming group, Nature Connections and Youth Board.
<br><br>

<p>Our youth groups are open to <strong>all young trans people</strong>, no matter how you identify or whether you are questioning your gender. We use trans as an umbrella term and are fully inclusive of non-binary individuals; please don't worry about not feeling 'trans enough'.</p>

<b><strong>There is no fee to access our youth groups. We can reimburse travel up to £10 per person at every session. Please bring a receipt with you where possible. If £10 is not enough for you to be able to attend our groups, send us an email and we think about other options.</strong><br><br>

  <strong>At the youth groups you can:</strong></b>

<br>

<ul><li>Meet other young trans, transgender, non-binary or gender questioning people, socialise, make friends, have fun and get some support</li>
<li>Find out information about coming out / disclosing, transitioning, your rights as a trans child, teenager or young adult, how to negotiate life post-transition, and more</li>
<li>Have a safe and supportive space to explore your gender identity if you're questioning, be yourself if you're not out, or have an opportunity to chat about trans stuff.</li></ul></div>

<h2>Online Youth Groups</h2>

<p>We are currently running youth groups online alongside our in person sessions.</p> 

<div id="online">Please email <a href="mailto:youthwork@genderedintelligence.co.uk"><b>youthwork@genderedintelligence.co.uk</a></b> with the subject <strong>‘ONLINE YOUTH GROUPS’.</strong> Include your name, age, whereabouts you live in the country and if you are ok with being contacted by phone, by a GI youth worker. A worker will arrange a time to call or text you. This is an initial check-in and find out your needs for being involved. You don’t have to send any details at first if you just want to ask us a question. If you don’t want to speak on the phone we can email back and forward with you to assess your needs. Once you have spoken with us and shared your membership details, you will then be added to the mailing list so you can join the next online session. 
<br><br>
<b>Then what?</b>
The lead youth worker will then send you and email with a link to the online space.
<br><br>
These are trying times, but as trans people our community is familiar with overcoming challenges and we will adapt. <i>If you're a young trans person, please know that we have no intentions of leaving you to face the times ahead without support - we will continue to support you for as long as 
  </i>. If you're worried about how things are, or concerned about your well-being or safety if you need to isolate, let us know and we will do what we can to support you.

<h2>One-to-one support</h2>

All our youth workers are trans, and you can choose if you'd like to speak to a worker with a similar identity/experience to yourself. lease contact us on youthwork@genderedintelligence.co.uk if you need to talk to a youth worker.</p>
