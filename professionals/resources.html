<h2>Trans Inclusion at Work Policy Skeleton</h2>

<p>Are you looking to develop or improve your policies regarding trans inclusion at work?</p>

<p>Any organisation wanting to improve its trans inclusivity is welcome to <a href="mailto:simon.croft@genderedintelligence.co.uk">contact us</a> for a free copy of our "Trans Inclusion at Work" Policy Skeleton and accompanying checklist. This covers not only supporting staff around transition, but all the aspects that need to be considered in your wider policy framework.</p>

<h2>Trans Inclusion at Work Policy Skeleton</h2>
<br>
<p>To accompany the above skeleton, we offer a basic glossary of key terms used in the glossary which can be <a href="../static/pdfs/GI Example Descriptions of Terms v1.1 Nov 22.pdf">downloaded here</a>.  More extensive glossaries are listed in the 'Resource List for Professionals' above.</p>

<p>Please note that these glossaries are intended as guidelines to support trans inclusion at work, not as exhaustive definitions. They do not necessarily represent the identity or experience of everyone at Gendered Intelligence or in the wider trans community.</p>

<h2>Monitoring and Data Capture: Gender-Related Options</h2>

<p>Are you looking for guidance on how to collect gender-related data for monitoring forms? This document offers some key principles and advice from a trans inclusion perspective.</p>

<h2>Downloadable toilet signs</h2>

<p>Gendered Intelligence provides signs which you can download, print and use as temporary signage for toilets.</p>

<p>These signs can be used when you are hiring an external venue and want to set a higher standard of inclusivity for the toilets. Using these signs can also be a good way to start a conversation with venues about their facilities and promote trans inclusive practice.</p>

<h2>Football Association: A Guide to Including Trans People in Football</h2>

<p><img src="/static/images/2016/09/13/Capture4.PNG" height="100px" width="200px">
<br>
<br>
In 2015 Gendered Intelligence worked closely with the <a href="http://www.thefa.com/">Football Association</a> on their guide to including trans people in football.</p>

<p>The new guidance is based on the FA’s core ethos that <strong>football is for everyone</strong>.</p>

<p>The guide covers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Terminology</li>
<li>Laws that protect trans people</li>
<li>How to tackle discrimination at your club</li>
<li>Making positive steps towards inclusion</li>
<li>Issues around ‘fairness of competition’</li>
<li>Supporting trans people as managers, players, supporters and other football roles</li>
<li>Testimonies from trans people who play, watch and coach football</li>
</ul>

<p><br></p>

<form action="/static/images/2016/09/13/09-50-06-transpeople-in-football-guide.pdf"><button type="submit" class="btn btn-large btn-inverse">PDF version</button>
</form>

<p><br></p>

<p>To accompany the guidance, Gendered Intelligence has produced a short film about trans people playing football. We hope the video will lead to greater understanding for people who play football and are involved in football at semi-professional and grass-roots levels.</p>

<p><strong>Watch the film</strong></p>

<h2>Issues of Bullying Around Trans and Gender Variant Students in Schools, Colleges and Universities</h2>

<p>The Anti-Bullying Alliance is keen to ensure that trans people are not being left out of the anti-bullying policies that are being implemented across schools, colleges and Universities in the UK. We were asked us to gather some of the experiences of young trans and gender variant people in and around schools.</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/2012/11/17/17-43-50-IOB.jpg"></p>

<p>The report is available online here:</p>
