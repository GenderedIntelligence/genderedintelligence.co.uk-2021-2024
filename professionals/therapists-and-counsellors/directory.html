<p><strong>Information about the directory for those looking for a therapist or counsellor</strong></p>

<p>The therapists and counsellors who are listed in this directory do not work for, and are not part of, Gendered Intelligence. All therapists and counsellors listed here run their own private practices or are part of other services that offer counselling or therapy.</p>

<p>You will find contact details under each listing – you can contact the therapist/counsellor directly. Some members of the GI network can offer special rates or free places for young trans people who come to Gendered Intelligence youth groups.</p>

<p>This directory is available to all members of the trans community, including young members of the GI youth groups and the Parents and Carers group.</p>

<p><strong>Please note that the directory is updated on a quarterly basis. If you are expecting to see your name here but do not, feel free to contact admin@genderedintelligence.co.uk.</strong></p>
