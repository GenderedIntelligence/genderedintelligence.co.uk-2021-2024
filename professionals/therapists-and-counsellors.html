<h2>Gendered Intelligence Network for Therapists and Counsellors</h2>

<p>The Gendered Intelligence (GI) Network for Therapists and Counsellors aims to support therapists and counsellors to enable trans and gender questioning people (and their families) to have a positive experience in a therapy setting.</p>

<h2>Working Alongside Trans, Gender Diverse and Questioning People: A two-day training course for therapists and counsellors</h2>

<p>In order to become part of the GI Network of Therapists and Counsellors, you must undertake our training course, <strong>"Working Alongside Trans, Gender Diverse and Questioning People".</strong></p>

<p>This two-day course has been created in response to demand for more in-depth and specialist learning from therapists and counsellors themselves, and to the need of the trans community for a pool of trans-knowledgeable therapists and counsellors to draw on.</p>

<p>The training will be a mix of formal presentations, interactive exercises and reflective discussions delivered in a small group learning environment by two professional trainers who combine extensive therapeutic and trans-specific knowledge and practice.</p>

<p>A note about language: On this page, we use the term ‘trans’ to refer to the broad spectrum of people who feel that the sex/gender they were assigned at birth does not match or sit easily with their sense of self. It is a broad term and includes people who might describe themselves as non-binary, gender fluid, agender, transgender, transsexual, and men or women of trans history, among many other words. We also recognise that people may be questioning or exploring their gender identity and not identify as trans, and that people may or may not identify as trans in the future.</p>
