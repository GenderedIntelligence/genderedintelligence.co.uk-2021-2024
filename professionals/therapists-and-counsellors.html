<h2>Gendered Intelligence Network for Therapists and Counsellors</h2>

<p>The Gendered Intelligence (GI) Network for Therapists and Counsellors aims to support therapists and counsellors to enable trans and gender questioning people (and their families) to have a positive experience in a therapy setting.</p>

<h2>Working Alongside Trans, Gender Diverse and Questioning People: A two-day training course for therapists and counsellors</h2>

<p>In order to become part of the GI Network of Therapists and Counsellors, you must undertake our training course, <strong>"Working Alongside Trans, Gender Diverse and Questioning People".</strong></p>

<p>This two-day course has been created in response to demand for more in-depth and specialist learning from therapists and counsellors themselves, and to the need of the trans community for a pool of trans-knowledgeable therapists and counsellors to draw on.</p>

<p>The training will be a mix of formal presentations, interactive exercises and reflective discussions delivered in a small group learning environment by two professional trainers who combine extensive therapeutic and trans-specific knowledge and practice.</p>
