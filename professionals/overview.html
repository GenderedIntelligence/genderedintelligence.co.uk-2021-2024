<h2>Professional and Educational Services - Overview</h2>

<p><strong>Gendered Intelligence’s Professional and Educational Services department</strong> offers a broad spectrum of practical services that enable organisations and individuals to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increase their understandings of gender diversity</li>
<li>Improve their practices</li>
<li>Become more trans inclusive in their working lives / professional settings</li>
</ul>

<p>We work with all sizes and types of organisations across the public, private and not-for-profit sectors.  We work wherever we are needed, throughout the UK, and increasingly internationally.</p>

<p>Our staff have a wealth of experience, qualifications, community connections, and a depth and breadth of trans-related knowledge that is second to none.</p>

<p>We are thought leaders in this field, and bring positivity, passion, professionalism and an open, non-judgmental approach to everything we do.  Working with GI enables nuanced discussion and innovation in inclusive practices to the benefit of all.
<br>
<br>
