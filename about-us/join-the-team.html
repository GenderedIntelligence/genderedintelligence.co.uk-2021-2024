<p>Gendered Intelligence (GI) is a registered not-for-profit charity, established in 2008. Our mission is to increase understandings of gender diversity and to improve the lives of trans people. We work predominantly with the trans community and those who impact on trans lives; we particularly specialise in supporting young trans people aged 8-30.</p>

<h2>Join the team</h2>
<p>Gendered Intelligence consists of a team of skilled trainers, youth workers, mentors, public speakers, consultants, workshop facilitators and community practitioners, who are supported by individuals with administrative, finance, research, policy, communications and IT skills.  We have a working and in-depth knowledge of the wider trans community and of the young trans community in particular. </p>

<p>Gendered Intelligence is a trans-led organisation, which means most members of the team are trans. We feel strongly that there is not one way of being trans, and there are many different ways and approaches to help GI achieve its aims. </p>

<p>We are keen to ensure that collectively the team is diverse in order that we can draw from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives and styles of thinking and working. As the organisation grows this is more important than ever. </p>

<h2>Vacancies</h2><br>

<h3>Finance Officer</h3><br>

<p>We are seeking an experienced, self-motivated and organised individual with previous experience in bookkeeping or accounting. You will join our small existing team, providing support across the wider GI staff cohort. In the last few years our organisation has passed the threshold for a full annual audit, and also for VAT registration; we are continually working to adapt and improve our internal processes. This role will therefore provide opportunities for professional growth in the charity finance sector for the successful applicant.</p>

<p>Whilst the majority of staff are trans-identified, we welcome cis allies at all levels, and have a number of cis people working for us.</p><br>

<p><strong>Salary:</strong> £27,852 – £30,151 per annum pro rata + £3,000 London Weighting where applicable</p>
<p><strong>Hours:</strong> FTE (35 hours/week)</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> London (flexible working supported but regular attendance at London office will be required)</p>
<p><strong>Deadline:</strong> 9am Monday 15th May 2023</p><br>
