<p>Gendered Intelligence (GI) is a registered not-for-profit charity, established in 2008. Our mission is to increase understandings of gender diversity and to improve the lives of trans people. We work predominantly with the trans community and those who impact on trans lives; we particularly specialise in supporting young trans people aged 8-30.</p>

<h2>Join the team</h2>
<p>Gendered Intelligence consists of a team of skilled trainers, youth workers, mentors, public speakers, consultants, workshop facilitators and community practitioners, who are supported by individuals with administrative, finance, research, policy, communications and IT skills.  We have a working and in-depth knowledge of the wider trans community and of the young trans community in particular. </p>

<p>Gendered Intelligence is a trans-led organisation, which means most members of the team are trans. We feel strongly that there is not one way of being trans, and there are many different ways and approaches to help GI achieve its aims. </p>

<p>We are keen to ensure that collectively the team is diverse in order that we can draw from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives and styles of thinking and working. As the organisation grows this is more important than ever. </p>

<h2>Vacancies</h2><br>

<h3>Finance Officer</h3><br>

<p>This is a new position created to support the growing financial needs of our organisation. Gendered Intelligence is a charity with a strong history, due to celebrate its 15th birthday this summer, and we are developing rapidly. We have seen an expansion since 2015 in both activity and associated income/ expenditure. In 2021 we secured more than £1m income, triggering the need for our first externally audited end of year accounts. Other recent milestones include the appointment of a Treasurer to our Board of Trustees to support our financial management, and our registration for VAT due to our increased taxable income. This means there are new challenges for our existing team, both within the volume of transactions now being processed, and the nature of the tasks involved.</p>
<p>This role will provide opportunities for professional growth in the charity finance sector for the successful applicant.</p>
<p>Current financial activity within GI is led by our Finance and Central Services (FCS) Manager, with oversight from Director of Public Engagement and Central Support Services (PECSS) and practical support from the existing Finance Officer. You will join this small team in supporting the wider GI staff cohort. </p>
<p>The vast majority of our team are home-based, but we currently retain a small number of desks in a shared office space near Kings Cross in London.</p><br>

<p><strong>Salary:</strong> £27,852 – £30,151 per annum pro rata + £3,000 London Weighting where applicable</p>
<p><strong>Hours:</strong> FTE (35 hours/week)</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> London (flexible working supported but regular attendance at London office will be required)</p>
<p><strong>Deadline:</strong> 9am Monday 15th May 2023</p><br>
