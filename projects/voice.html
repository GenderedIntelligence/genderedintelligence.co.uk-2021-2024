<h2>An Introduction to Gender-Affirming Voice</h2>

<p>The Laurels Gender Identity Clinic Speech and Language Therapists are collaborating with us as part of their support for people waiting to access care. Two specialists in gender affirming voice/vocal therapy at The Laurels will help you understand a little more about voice in general and ways to improve your comfort with your voice.</p>

<p>In the session there will be an opportunity to explore your voice in a safe environment and to talk with people with lived experience of having gender affirming voice therapy.</p>

<p>We will be running this session twice - once online and once in person. These sessions are free to attend.</p>

<p><strong>Some of the areas we will cover are:</strong>
  <ul><li>What is voice?</li>
    <li>The challenge of change</li>
    <li>Perspective of people with lived experience</li>
    <li>Practical voice exploration</li>
    <li>Q&A and final thoughts</li></ul></p>
  
<p><strong>Online Group</strong>
<ul><li>Wednesday 5th April, 4-6pm on Zoom (you'll be sent the Zoom link after signing up)</li>
  <li>You can sit with a friend next to you if that makes you feel more comfortable</li>
  <li>You don't have to participate if you don't feel able - feel free to just listen</li></ul></p>

<p><strong>In-Person Group</strong>
<ul><li><strong>When:</strong> Sunday 4th June, 11am to 230pm (session 11-1pm and then lunch and chatting till 230pm)</li>
  <li><strong>Where:</strong> Trinity Center, Bristol</li> 
<li>We will also be providing lunch and space to get to know each other after the workshop. You of course donâ€™t need to stay for this but we want to create a space for you to meet other people and perhaps form support practising your voice with each other!</li>
  <li>For the lunch we will also invite trans groups from Bristol</li></ul></p>
