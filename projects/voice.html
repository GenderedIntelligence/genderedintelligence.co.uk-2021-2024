<h2>An Introduction to Gender-Affirming Voice</h2>

<p>The Laurels Gender Identity Clinic Speech and Language Therapists are collaborating with us as part of their support for people waiting to access care. Three specialists in gender affirming voice/vocal therapy at The Laurels will help you understand a little more about voice in general and ways to improve your comfort with your voice.</p>

<p>In the session there will be an opportunity to explore your voice in a safe environment and to talk with people with lived experience of having gender affirming voice therapy.</p>

<p><strong>Some of the areas we will cover are:</strong>
  <ul><li>What is voice?</li>
    <li>The challenge of change</li>
    <li>Perspective of people with lived experience</li>
    <li>Practical voice exploration</li>
    <li>Q&A and final thoughts</li></ul></p>

<p>This is an introductory session and so may not be useful for those of you who are already receiving voice therapy or are already working to a framework that works for you. 
</p>

<p><strong>Online Group</strong></p>

<p><ul><li>Tuesday 5th December, 5-7pm on Zoom (you’ll be sent the zoom link after signing up)</li>
<li>You can sit with a friend next to you if that makes you feel more comfortable</li>
<li>You don’t have to participate if you don't feel able - feel free to just listen</li></ul></p>
