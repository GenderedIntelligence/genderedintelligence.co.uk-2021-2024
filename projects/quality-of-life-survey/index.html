<h2>Quality of Life Survey</h2>

<p>Since 2016, Gendered Intelligence and Dr Jo Lloyd have run an online survey on the quality of life of trans and gender diverse adults in England. On the study's 7th year in 2022, <a href="https://www.uel.ac.uk/about-uel/staff/jo-lloyd"><strong>Dr Lloyd</strong></a> is now Head of the Professional Psychology Department in the School of Psychology, at the University of East London (UEL)*. 
	
	
	</p>This longitudinal study, lasting 10 years, will offer snapshots into the quality of life of trans people in England year-by-year.</p>

<p>The first survey ran from August - October 2016 — which over 900 people took part in! — and we have been doing it every year since.

<p><h2><i class="fas fa-calendar-check" style="color:#000000"></i> 2022 study timeline</h2>

This year's study will run from August - October, and is more important than ever! From July to the end of August 2022, we'll be communicating with return participants to encourage them to fill out this year's survey. It's really important that we're able to have as many returners as possible, so that we're able to show how things have or haven't <a href="/projects/quality-of-life-survey/background.html">changed over time</a>. Throughout September and October 2022, GI will be reaching out to trusted networks to ask them to share the survey with their audiences. <br>

<p><h2><i class="far fa-folder-open" style="color:#000000"></i> Brief Report of Initial Findings</h2>

<p>In May 2018, we produced brief report of our findings from our initial survey in 2016.</p>

<p>The report looks at what impacts a range of quality of life indicators - including life satisfaction, mental health, self-esteem, social inclusion and cultural participation.</p>

<p>We shared these initial findings at our last Gendered Intelligence conference (in November 2018).</p>
