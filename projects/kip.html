<h2>Knowledge is Power: A Guide for Young Trans People</h2>

<p>Knowledge is Power: A guide for Young Trans People is an update on a resource from 2015 (see below), providing key information for young trans people, as well as families, carers, friends and loved ones. This resource includes key information about exploring your gender, accessing support, finding community, transition, gender expression and style guides, mental health, sports groups, legal rights as well trans joy and much more!</p>

<p>Through this resource you can gain a better understanding of how to navigate the world as a young trans person, and find empowering and useful knowledge for wherever you may be on your trans or gender questioning journey. It is written by the community for the community and we hope you will find it useful.</p>

<p>We would like to thank Santi from G(end)er Swap for contributing an invaluable style guide, our amazing colleagues at Galop for their insights and our colleagues/community members across Gendered Intelligence for their contributions on trans joy.</p>

<p>The resource is free and downloadable as a pdf below. We are producing a shorter, less text heavy version for anyone who may need - watch this space!</p>
