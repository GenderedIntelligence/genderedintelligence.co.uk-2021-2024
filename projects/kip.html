<h2>Knowledge is Power: A Guide for Young Trans People</h2>

<p>Knowledge is Power: A guide for Young Trans People is an update on a resource from 2015, providing key information for young trans people, as well as families, carers, friends and loved ones. This resource includes key information about exploring your gender, accessing support, finding community, transition, gender expression and style guides, mental health, sports groups, legal rights as well trans joy and much more!</p>

<p>Through this resource you can gain a better understanding of how to navigate the world as a young trans person, and find empowering and useful knowledge for wherever you may be on your trans or gender questioning journey. It is written by the community, for the community, and we hope you will find it useful.</p>

<p></p>Over a 12 month period, we gathered information and experiences from young trans, gender variant and questioning people through a series of youth sessions. We also assembled research and writing from a diverse team of Gendered Intelligence community members.</p>

<p>You can use KIP to find information about:<ul><li>Identity</li>
<li>Coming out</li>
<li>Transition</li>
<li>Clothes, hair, and style (including safe binding)</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Changing your name</li>
<li>Legal gender recognition</li></ul></p>

<p>Our Knowledge is Power project will provide you with lots of information, but itâ€™s up to you to convert that into knowledge.</p>

<p>The resource is free and downloadable as a PDF below.</p>
