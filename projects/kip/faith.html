</ul>
<p>We're a group of LGBT+ Catholics attached to the Church of the Immaculate Conception at Farm Street, who meet for Mass and socialising every second Sunday of the month. I was wondering whether we might be included in your list of faith support groups? While we're part of the the RC Archdiocese of Westminster's pastoral provision to LGBT+ Catholics, their families and friends, we are not associated with groups like Courage. You may have also heard of us as the group that met for the 'Soho Masses', which was founded after the bombing of the Admiral Duncan pub - we moved to Farm Street in 2013.</p>
