<h2>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</h2>
<br>
In 2019-2021 we received funding from Sport England primarily to do three things:
<ul><li>To carry out qualitative research on trans inclusion in sport and physical activity;</li>
  <li>To develop and deliver training on practical trans inclusion in grassroots sport;</li>
  <li>To develop written guidance to support trans inclusion in grassroots sport and physical</li>
  <li>activity for both National Governing Bodies (NGBs) and trans people themselves.</li></ul>
<br>
We are pleased that we were able to put this funding to good use. We have gathered important
information on the questions and experiences that NGBs have relating to trans inclusion, as well as
the experiences of trans people in sport, and developed several case studies. We have also
developed and delivered substantial training (which was very well received, both by participants and
by Sport England). We have also advanced our own organisational knowledge and understanding
around trans inclusion in sport and physical activity.
<br>
However, during the course of the work, Sport England made the decision to revisit the Sports
Council Equalities Group (SCEG) Guidance for Transgender Inclusion in Domestic Sport and placed
much of our planned work on hold.
<br>
When the updated Guidance was released, it became clear that Gendered Intelligence would not be
able to support it. We could not deliver training or produce documentation which repeated or
supported the core messages of the Guidance, like the claim that, “Competitive fairness cannot be
reconciled with self-identification.” This meant that there was no practical way to continue with the
work while also supporting the community we serve. We have a responsibility to stand up for better
inclusion and equity for trans people in sport, and the updated Guidance does not reflect this. We
fed these views back to Sport England, but the Guidance will not be reviewed for 2 years.
<br>
In late 2021, we ceased all spend on work with Sport England, and returned the unspent portion of
the grant.
<br>
We remain open to working with Sport England around trans inclusion in sport. We believe there
are constructive ways of moving forward, and we look forward to being invited to contribute to
discussions and research.
<br>
Despite the funded work coming to a necessary end, we have been able to do a great deal of
positive work. We plan to release the qualitative research in due course, and we will continue to
offer positive, practical trans inclusion training and consultancy in line with the International
Olympic Committee Framework.
<br>
We look forward to a world where everyone has equitable access to sport and physical activity.
