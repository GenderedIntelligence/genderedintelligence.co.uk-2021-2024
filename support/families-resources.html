<h2>Knowledge is Power</h2>

<p><img src="/static/images/2015/08/14/12-56-52-knowledge is power bannere.png"></p>

<p><a href="https://genderedintelligence.co.uk/projects/kip">Knowledge is Power</a> is a project funded by Awards for All. It gathered knowledge generated through a series of youth sessions, as well as research and writing carried out by a diverse team of GI community members.</p>

<p>At Gendered Intelligence we think knowledge is not the same as information. Knowledge is something that comes from within. Knowledge comes when an individual has received information but has processed it in a way that offers meaning to their life.</p>
