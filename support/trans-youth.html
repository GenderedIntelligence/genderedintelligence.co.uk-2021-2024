<h2>Youth Groups</h2>

<p>Gendered Intelligence runs trans youth groups in London and Leeds for a range of ages from 7 to 30. We also run a peer-led support group in London for those aged 18-30.</p>

<p>Our youth groups are open to <strong>all young trans people</strong>, no matter how you identify or whether you are questioning your gender. We use trans as an umbrealla term and are fully inclusive of non-binary individuals; please don't worry about not feeling 'trans enough'.</p>

<p>Since 2010, we've taken young trans people on a weekend camping trip: an annual opportunity to take part in lots of fun activities and spend time with other young trans people. This is open to young trans people from the age of 11 – 25 years. <a href="../trans-youth/camping.html">Read more</a>.</p>
