<h2>Regular donations</h2>

<p>Becoming a regular giver by Standing Order is one of the best ways you can help Gendered Intelligence continue its work improving the lives of trans people. It helps us to plan ahead, and it cuts our administration costs, meaning that more money can go directly into our work. You can set up a standing order by using <a href="https://localgiving.org/donation/genderedintelligence/monthly?emb=RVJS6lFwPf">Localgiving</a> - if you are a UK taxpayer and tick the GiftAid box, then we receive an additional 25p for every £1 that you give! </p>

<p>If you wish to make your payment online simply click on the one monthly donation button below:</p>

<h2>Gendered Intelligence Friends Scheme</h2>

<p>Become a friend of Gendered Intelligence by donating monthly to our Friends Scheme. We want to make a difference by increasing opportunities, building skills, and empowering trans youth. Donating monthly to our organisation means that you aid our trans youth support work and volunteering scheme continuously - and it doesn't have to cost you more than a cup of coffee and a morning pastry! Pick one of the categories below or contact us about a set amount you'd like to give. In return, we will send you updates on what your donations are helping achieve at Gendered Intelligence and what we're up to (if you choose).</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Gold Friend</strong> - £3 a month subscription. Your donation helps us provide refreshments for our trans youth group meetings. Even a donation as little as £3 can aid our organisation in providing a quality space for trans youth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Platinum Friend</strong> - £10 a month subscription. Your donation provides travel bursaries for trans youth who may need assistance attending our monthly meetings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diamond Friend</strong> - £25 or more a month subscription. Your donation goes towards keeping things running behind the scenes. Staff costs, facilitators, building costs, etc. all allow us to provide quality spaces for trans youth.</p></li>
</ul>
