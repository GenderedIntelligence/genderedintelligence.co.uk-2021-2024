<h2>Do you want to volunteer for Gendered Intelligence? </h2>

<p>Gendered Intelligence exists to increase understanding of gender diversity and to improve the quality of lifeof trans people, and young trans people in particular. To achieve this we need our brilliant volunteer community to support the work we do!<br><br></p>

<p>Volunteers are vital support to the work at Gendered Intelligence: <br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>They are crucial resources (extra pair of hands) to help meet the needs of our service user in each one of our community projects.</p></li>
<li><p>They bring their own unique skills and perspectives and enrich our community by their diversity.</p></li>
<li><p>They help GI build a more inclusive sense of trans community for other volunteers and service users, representing different lived experiences.</p></li>
<li><p>Volunteering can help combat the lower rates of employment in the trans community by giving volunteers opportunities to gain experience and training relevant to their vocational interests which helps with CV and employment skills development.</p></li>
</ul>
