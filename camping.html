<h2>Camp Bookings 2023 open in April</h2>

<p>Our summer camp booking will be going live 17th April 9am and will be open for one week. We will send you plenty of reminders closer to the time.</p>

<p>This year our camps will be:
<ul><li>11-17 year olds Monday 31st July -  Thursday 3rd August (Saturday 1st July prep day, you must attend prep day to attend camp)</li>
<li>16-25 year olds Friday 18th August - Monday 21st August (Saturday 8th July prep day, you must attend prep day to attend camp)</li></ul></p>

<p>Camps are at no cost to young people. However, donations are very welcome and will contribute to costs of future residentials.<p>

<p>This year booking will primarily be randomly allocated after the booking closes. We have 40 spaces available for both camps. 10 spaces will be reserved for people who have not been camping with us before, 10 people will be reserved for trans people of colour, and 10 spaces will be reserved for transfeminine young people. </p>

<p>We know that the past few years have been really hard and we would take everyone on camp if we could. This year we are asking everyone who attended both camps in 2021 and in 2022 to take a break from camp for one summer (you can still apply if you only attended camp one of these years). It doesn’t mean that you deserve camp any less. We think it’s really important that everyone has a chance to experience camp magic, so we want to allow space for people who haven’t been on camp yet.</p>

<p>You can join our other residentials over the next year though! </p>
<p><ul><li>In early 2023 we will be taking a bunch of transfeminine young people involved in our gaming project on a one night residential </li>
<li>In May we will be training up new youth workers to volunteer and work at residentials. The training will be a two-night residential (if you’re over 18 and interested in finding out more, let us know!)</li>
<li>14th - 16th July we will take a group of 16-25 year olds for a two-night residential for Trans Pride Brighton (spaces reserved for anyone not coming camping with us)</li>
<li>In autumn 2023 there will also be a Leeds/Northern residential and a residential for trans people of colour </li></ul></p>
<p>Plus other trips and projects announced later!</p>

<p>We know that finding out that you might not be able to join camp this year might be disappointing for many. That’s also why we wanted to let you know as soon as possible. If you’d like to speak to a youth worker about this, please get in touch. And let’s also keep you connected with everything else we are offering. </p>

<p>We are currently working hard to build even more residentials and other opportunities for young trans, non-binary and gender-questioning people across the UK.</p>

<p>If you have any worries, questions or concerns, please talk to a youth worker, or email us on: youthwork@genderedintelligence.co.uk </p>
