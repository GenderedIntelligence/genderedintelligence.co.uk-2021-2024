					<h2>Trans Inclusive Residentials - new guidance</h2>

<p><strong>Trans Inclusive Residentials: A Free Resource for Youth Workers, Schools and Organisations</strong></p>

<p>Gendered Intelligence has released <a href="/static/pdfs/GI_youth_RESIDENTIAL 120722.pdf">new guidance</a> to support youth workers, community workers and staff in educational settings to run residentials that are inclusive of young trans people.</p>

<p>Based on 10 yearsâ€™ experience of running residentials for young trans people, we want to share the key knowledge and advice developed by our youth workers over a decade.</p>

<p>The guidance covers a wide range of areas from changing facilities and sleeping arrangements, to outdoor activities, offsite visits, residentials abroad and how to support young people once the residential has come to an end.</p>

<p>This guidance is aimed at youth workers, community workers and staff in educational settings who are likely to be running residential trips.</p>

<p>However, it may also be a valuable resource for staff working on residential sites, parents/carers of young trans people and anyone else who is considering how to run or support a trans-inclusive residential.</p>

<p>You can download a PDF version of the guidance below.</p>
